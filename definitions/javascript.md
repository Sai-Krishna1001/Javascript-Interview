| **__WeakMap__**                   | A `WeakMap` is a collection of key/value pairs in which the keys are weakly referenced, allowing for garbage collection if there are no other references.                  |
| **__WeakSet__**                   | A `WeakSet` is a collection of unique values, similar to a `Set`, but the values are weakly referenced.                                                                    |
