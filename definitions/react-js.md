| **__Code Splitting__**            | Code splitting is a technique used to improve application performance by splitting the code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. React supports code splitting with dynamic `import()` and React.lazy. |
| **__Component__**                 | A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of UI that can be a class or a function. Components accept inputs, called props, and return React elements that describe what should appear on the screen. |
| **__Context__**                   | Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It is useful for global data, such as the current authenticated user or theme. |
| **__Custom Hooks__**              | Custom hooks are reusable functions that encapsulate common logic using React hooks. They allow you to share stateful logic between components without duplicating code. |
| **__Error Boundaries__**          | Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire component tree. |
| **__Hooks__**                     | Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`. |
| **__Immutable Data Structures__** | Immutable data structures ensure that data is not changed directly. Instead, operations create new data structures. This concept is often used in React to ensure predictable state updates and improve performance. |
| **__JSX__**                       | JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It is used to describe the UI structure and is transformed into JavaScript by tools like Babel. |
| **__JSX Spread Attributes__**     | JSX spread attributes allow you to pass all properties of an object as props to a component. It is a concise way to pass a collection of props without having to specify each one explicitly. |
| **__Lifecycle Methods__**         | Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that are invoked at different stages of a component's life, such as `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`. |
| **__Props__**                     | Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed from a parent component to a child component. They are used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree. |
| **__React Context API__**         | The React Context API is a way to manage global state in a React application. It allows you to create a context and provide data to any component in the component tree, avoiding the need to pass props down manually at each level. |
| **__React DevTools__**            | React DevTools is a browser extension that allows you to inspect the React component hierarchy, view state and props, and debug performance issues in your React applications. |
| **__React Router__**              | React Router is a library used for routing in React applications. It allows developers to navigate between different views or pages of an application, maintaining the UI in sync with the URL. |
| **__React.memo__**                | `React.memo` is a higher-order component that optimizes functional components by memoizing the rendered output. It helps prevent unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed. |
| **__Reconciliation__**            | Reconciliation in React.js is the process of updating the DOM efficiently by comparing the new virtual DOM with the previous one, identifying changes, and applying only the necessary updates to the actual DOM. This minimizes performance overhead and ensures fast, responsive updates. |
| **__Redux__**                     | Redux is a state management library often used with React to manage application state in a predictable way. It uses a single store to hold the entire state of the application and provides a way to dispatch actions to change the state. |
| **__Redux Thunk__**               | Redux Thunk is a middleware for Redux that allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. It is used to handle asynchronous logic in Redux applications. |
| **__Server-Side Rendering (SSR)__** | Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is the process of rendering React components on the server and sending the HTML to the client. It improves performance and SEO by reducing the time to first meaningful paint. |
| **__Suspense__**                  | Suspense is a React feature that allows you to display a fallback UI while waiting for asynchronous operations, such as code splitting or data fetching, to complete. |
| **__State__**                     | State is a built-in object in React components that holds data that may change over time. It is managed within the component and can be updated using the `setState` function or hooks like `useState`. |
| **__useEffect__**                 | The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It replaces lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` in class components. |
| **__useRef__**                    | The `useRef` hook allows you to create a mutable reference that persists across re-renders. It can be used to access DOM elements directly or store a value that does not cause re-renders when updated. |
| **__Virtual DOM__**               | The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM elements generated by React components. React uses this virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM by computing the minimal set of changes needed. |
