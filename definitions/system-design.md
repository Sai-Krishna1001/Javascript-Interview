| **__API Gateway__**   | A server that acts as an API front-end, receiving API requests, enforcing throttling and security policies, passing requests to the back-end service, and then returning the results. |
| **__Architecture__**  | The overall design of a system, including its components, structure, and behavior.                                                                 |
| **__Availability__**  | The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users, even in the face of hardware or software failures.                           |
| **__Cache__**         | A component that stores data so that future requests for that data can be served faster.                                                           |
| **__CAP Theorem__**   | A principle that states that in a distributed data store, it is impossible to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. |
| **__Component__**     | A part of a system that performs a specific function and can be replaced or updated without affecting the overall system.                           |
| **__Consistency__**   | Ensuring that a system's data is consistent across all nodes and remains accurate and up-to-date.                                                  |
| **__Design__**        | The process of creating a plan or blueprint for a system, product, or service.                                                                     |
| **__Distributed Systems__** | Systems that are spread across multiple machines or locations, often communicating over a network.                                                    |
| **__Elasticity__**    | The ability of a system to automatically expand and contract its resources based on current demands.                                                |
| **__Fault Tolerance__** | The ability of a system to continue operating in the face of hardware or software failures, by implementing redundant components or failover mechanisms.  |
| **__High Availability__** | A characteristic of a system that aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period.                    |
| **__Latency__**       | The time it takes for a data packet to travel from source to destination.                                                                          |
| **__Load Balancing__** | The distribution of traffic across multiple servers or resources to optimize performance and prevent overloading.                                         |
| **__Maintainability__** | The ease with which a system can be maintained, updated, and repaired over its lifetime.                                                                  |
| **__MicroServices__** | A software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. |
| **__Module__**        | A self-contained unit of code that performs a specific function and can be reused in different parts of a system.                                    |
| **__Monolithic Architecture__** | A software architecture pattern in which a single application is built as a single, indivisible unit.                                                           |
| **__Performance__**   | The speed and efficiency of a system in executing its tasks and delivering results to users.                                                        |
| **__Reliability__**   | The ability of a system to perform consistently and accurately, without errors or downtime.                                                         |
| **__Replication__**   | The process of copying and maintaining database objects, such as databases, in multiple locations to ensure reliability and fault-tolerance.        |
| **__Scalability__**   | The ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of data or traffic without experiencing performance issues.                                     |
| **__Security__**      | The protection of a system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other forms of cyber attack.                                               |
| **__Sharding__**      | A type of database partitioning that separates large databases into smaller, more manageable pieces called shards.                                   |
| **__System__**        | A group of interrelated components working together to achieve a common goal.                                                                      |
| **__Throughput__**    | The amount of work a system can handle in a given period of time, often measured in transactions per second or requests per second.                  |
