## System Design Key Terms:

* **Architecture:** The overrall design of a system, including its components, structure, and behavior.

* **Availability:** The ability of a system to remain operational and accessible to users, even in the face of hardware or software failures.
  
* **Component:** A part of a system that performs a specific function and can be replaced or updated without affecting the overrall system.

* **Design:** The process of creating a plan or blueprint for a system, product, or service.

* **Distributed Systems:** Systems that are spread across multitple machines or locations, often communicating over a network.

* **Fault Tolerance:** The ability of a system to continue operating in the face of hardware or software failures, by implementing redundant components or failover mechanisms.
  
* **Load balancing:** The distribution of traffic across multiple servers or resources to optimize performance and prevent overloading.

* **Maintainability:** The ease with which a system can be maintained, updated, and repaired over its lifetime.

* **MicroServices:** A software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small independent services that communicate with each other through APIs.
  
* **Module:** A self-contained unit of code that performs a specific function and can be reused in different parts of a system.

* **Performance:** The speed and efficiency of a system in executing of a system in executing its tasks and delivering results to users.

* **Reliability:** The ability of a system to perform consistently and accurately, without errors or downtime.
  
* **Security:** The protection of a system from unauthorized access, data breaches, and other forms of cyber attack.

* **Scalability:** The ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of data or traffic without experiencing performance issues.
  
* **System:** A group of interrelated components working together to achieve a common goal.
