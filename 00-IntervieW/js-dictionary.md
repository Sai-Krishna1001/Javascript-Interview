| **Keyword/Term**       | **Definition**                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variable**           | A named storage location for data. Declared using `var`, `let`, or `const`.                          |
| **Function**           | A block of code designed to perform a particular task. Invoked by its name followed by parentheses.  |
| **Arrow Function**     | A shorter syntax for writing functions, using `=>`.                                                  |
| **Array**              | A collection of elements, stored in a single variable, accessible via index.                        |
| **Object**             | A collection of properties, where each property is a key-value pair.                                |
| **Method**             | A function associated with an object.                                                               |
| **Callback Function**  | A function passed as an argument to another function, to be executed later.                         |
| **Promise**            | An object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.             |
| **Async/Await**        | Syntactic sugar over promises, making asynchronous code look synchronous.                           |
| **Closure**            | A function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside of that scope. |
| **Hoisting**           | JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of their scope before code execution.       |
| **Scope**              | The context in which variables and functions are accessible. Can be global or local.                |
| **Prototype**          | An object from which other objects inherit properties and methods.                                  |
| **Class**              | A blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. Introduced in ES6.        |
| **Constructor**        | A special method in a class used for initializing objects.                                          |
| **Inheritance**        | A mechanism to create a new class from an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.    |
| **Event Loop**         | A system that handles asynchronous operations by managing the execution of code, collecting and processing events. |
| **Event Propagation**  | The process by which an event flows through the DOM from the target element to the root. It includes capturing, targeting, and bubbling phases. |
| **Currying**           | A technique of evaluating functions with multiple arguments, one at a time.                         |
| **Destructuring**      | A syntax that allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.|
| **Spread Operator**    | Denoted by `...`, it expands an array or object into individual elements.                           |
| **Rest Operator**      | Also denoted by `...`, it collects multiple elements into a single array or object.                 |
| **Template Literals**  | Strings that allow embedded expressions and multi-line strings, using backticks (\`` `\`).          |
| **Truthy/Falsy**       | Values that are coerced to `true` or `false` in a Boolean context.                                  |
| **Strict Mode**        | A feature that allows you to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, catching common coding errors. |
| **Module**             | A file containing code that can be reused across multiple files. Managed using `import` and `export`.|
| **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** | A function that runs as soon as it is defined, using syntax like `(function() { ... })()`.|
| **Debouncing**         | A technique to limit the rate at which a function is executed. Typically used in handling events like resizing or scrolling. |
| **Throttling**         | Similar to debouncing but guarantees that the function is called at least once every specified interval. |
| **Shadow DOM**         | A DOM tree that is encapsulated within a component, preventing external styles from affecting it.    |
| **Polyfill**           | A piece of code that provides modern functionality in older browsers that do not support it.        |
| **Type Coercion**      | The automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another, such as strings to numbers. |
| **Event Delegation**   | A technique to handle events efficiently by attaching a single event listener to a parent element that listens for events on its child elements. |
| **Memoization**        | An optimization technique where the result of a function is cached based on its inputs to avoid recalculating the result. |
