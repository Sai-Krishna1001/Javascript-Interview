# Dynamic Interview Prompts for Frontend (React.js) Developers

## Component Building Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Create a component building challenge where the interviewer asks the candidate to build a complex React component from scratch. The candidate must implement the component, manage state, handle events, and ensure it is reusable and well-documented."

## Hook Exploration Format

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a hook exploration session where the interviewer presents various scenarios requiring custom hooks. The candidate must create custom hooks to solve these scenarios, explaining the advantages of their approach and how it improves the component's functionality."

## UI/UX Design Implementation

**Prompt:** 
"Conduct a UI/UX design implementation session where the interviewer provides a design mockup. The candidate must implement the design in React, ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and adherence to best practices."

## Performance Optimization Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a performance optimization challenge where the interviewer provides a React codebase with performance issues. The candidate must identify and resolve these issues, explaining the techniques used to optimize rendering and improve application performance."

## State Management Scenario

**Prompt:** 
"Create a state management scenario where the interviewer describes a complex state management problem. The candidate must implement a solution using React's Context API, Redux, or another state management library, justifying their choice and demonstrating their implementation."

## Testing and Debugging Session

**Prompt:** 
"Organize a testing and debugging session where the interviewer provides a React component with potential bugs and insufficient test coverage. The candidate must identify and fix the bugs, and write unit tests using a testing library like Jest and React Testing Library."

## Lifecycle Methods Deep Dive

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a deep dive session into React lifecycle methods where the interviewer presents various scenarios requiring different lifecycle methods. The candidate must demonstrate the use of lifecycle methods in both class components and functional components using hooks."

## Prop Drilling and Context API Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a challenge focusing on prop drilling and the Context API. The candidate must refactor a component tree that suffers from excessive prop drilling by implementing the Context API, explaining the benefits and potential pitfalls of this approach."

## Third-Party Library Integration

**Prompt:** 
"Conduct a third-party library integration session where the interviewer asks the candidate to integrate a popular third-party library (e.g., React Router, Axios, or Formik) into a React application. The candidate must demonstrate how to properly set up and use the library."

## Code Review and Refactoring

**Prompt:** 
"Organize a code review and refactoring session where the interviewer provides a suboptimal React codebase. The candidate must review the code, suggest improvements, and refactor it to enhance readability, maintainability, and performance."

## Contextual Theme Implementation

**Prompt:** 
"Create a contextual theme implementation challenge where the candidate must implement a theming solution using React Context API. The candidate should ensure that the application supports multiple themes (e.g., light and dark modes) and allows theme switching dynamically."

## Real-Time Data Handling

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a real-time data handling scenario where the interviewer asks the candidate to implement a component that subscribes to real-time updates using WebSockets or another real-time data protocol. The candidate must manage the incoming data efficiently and update the UI accordingly."

## Authentication Flow Implementation

**Prompt:** 
"Set up an authentication flow implementation session where the interviewer asks the candidate to build a complete authentication system using React. This should include login, logout, and session management, demonstrating secure handling of authentication tokens."

## Error Boundary Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Organize an error boundary challenge where the candidate must implement error boundaries to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree. The candidate should explain the concept, demonstrate its implementation, and discuss its importance in React applications."
