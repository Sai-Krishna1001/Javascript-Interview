# Dynamic Interview Prompts

## Chess Game-Like Format

**Prompt:** 
"Design an engaging interview discussion where the interviewer and candidate analyze a [topic] code snippet in a dynamic, chess game-like format. Ensure minimal changes to the original code, and focus on a one-on-one, interactive dialogue."

## Quiz Format

**Prompt:** 
"Design an interactive quiz-based interview where the interviewer presents multiple-choice questions related to a [topic] code snippet. The candidate must choose the correct answer and explain their reasoning."

## Pair Programming Format

**Prompt:** 
"Create a pair programming session where the interviewer and candidate collaboratively work on a [topic] code snippet. The candidate writes the code while explaining their thought process, and the interviewer provides real-time feedback and additional challenges."

## Scenario-Based Format

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a scenario-based interview where the interviewer gives the candidate a real-world problem related to a [topic] code snippet. The candidate must design and implement a solution, explaining each step and decision."

## Debugging Challenge Format

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a debugging challenge where the interviewer provides a [topic] code snippet with intentional bugs. The candidate must identify and fix the errors, explaining their debugging strategy and thought process."

## Role-Playing Format

**Prompt:** 
"Craft a role-playing interview where the interviewer and candidate assume specific roles (e.g., lead developer and junior developer) to discuss and improve a [topic] code snippet. The candidate must justify their improvements and respond to the interviewer's feedback."

## Whiteboard Session Format

**Prompt:** 
"Organize a whiteboard session where the candidate must diagram and pseudocode a solution for a problem related to a [topic] code snippet. The interviewer asks probing questions to understand the candidate's design and architectural decisions."

## Code Review Format

**Prompt:** 
"Conduct a code review session where the interviewer provides a [topic] code snippet, and the candidate must critique the code, suggesting improvements and optimizations. The candidate should focus on code quality, efficiency, and best practices."

## Case Study Format

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a case study interview where the candidate is given a detailed [topic] code snippet scenario. They must analyze the requirements, design an appropriate solution, implement the code, and present their approach to the interviewer."

## Live Coding Format

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a live coding session where the interviewer asks the candidate to write a [topic] code snippet from scratch. The candidate should explain their logic and approach while coding, and handle any on-the-spot questions or changes from the interviewer."

## Flashcard Format

**Prompt:** 
"Design a flashcard-based interview where the interviewer shows flashcards with questions or incomplete [topic] code snippets. The candidate must quickly respond with the correct answer or complete the code snippet correctly, explaining their reasoning."
