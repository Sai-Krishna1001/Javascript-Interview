# Dynamic Interview Prompts for Backend (Node.js) Developers

## API Design Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Create an API design challenge where the interviewer asks the candidate to design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. The candidate should handle routing, request validation, error handling, and implement CRUD operations."

## Asynchronous Programming Quiz

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a quiz-based interview focusing on asynchronous programming in Node.js. The interviewer presents multiple-choice and coding questions about callbacks, promises, and async/await. The candidate must choose the correct answer and explain their reasoning."

## Middleware Implementation

**Prompt:** 
"Conduct a middleware implementation session where the interviewer asks the candidate to write custom middleware for an Express application. The candidate should demonstrate how to use middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling."

## Real-Time Communication Scenario

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a real-time communication scenario where the candidate must implement a WebSocket server using Node.js and Socket.io. The candidate should handle real-time data exchange between the server and multiple clients."

## Database Integration Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Create a database integration challenge where the interviewer asks the candidate to connect a Node.js application to a database (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL). The candidate should demonstrate how to perform CRUD operations and manage database connections efficiently."

## Microservices Architecture Design

**Prompt:** 
"Develop a microservices architecture design session where the interviewer asks the candidate to break down a monolithic Node.js application into microservices. The candidate should discuss service decomposition, communication between services, and deployment strategies."

## Unit Testing and TDD

**Prompt:** 
"Organize a unit testing and test-driven development (TDD) session where the interviewer asks the candidate to write unit tests for a Node.js module using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest. The candidate should implement TDD principles by writing tests before code."

## Performance Optimization Challenge

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a performance optimization challenge where the interviewer provides a Node.js application with performance issues. The candidate must identify bottlenecks, optimize code, and suggest improvements to enhance the application's performance."

## Error Handling and Logging

**Prompt:** 
"Create an error handling and logging session where the interviewer asks the candidate to implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms in a Node.js application. The candidate should demonstrate how to use libraries like Winston for logging and handle different types of errors."

## Security Best Practices

**Prompt:** 
"Conduct a security best practices interview where the interviewer asks the candidate to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in a Node.js application. The candidate should demonstrate knowledge of common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and how to mitigate them."

## Authentication and Authorization Implementation

**Prompt:** 
"Set up an authentication and authorization implementation session where the interviewer asks the candidate to build a complete authentication system using Node.js. This should include user registration, login, JWT-based authentication, and role-based access control."

## API Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Prompt:** 
"Develop an API rate limiting and throttling session where the interviewer asks the candidate to implement rate limiting in an Express application. The candidate should use middleware to limit the number of requests from a single IP address to prevent abuse."

## File Handling and Uploads

**Prompt:** 
"Organize a file handling and uploads session where the interviewer asks the candidate to implement file upload functionality in a Node.js application. The candidate should handle file storage, validation, and error handling during the upload process."

## Dependency Injection

**Prompt:** 
"Set up a dependency injection challenge where the interviewer asks the candidate to refactor a Node.js application to use dependency injection. The candidate should explain the benefits of this approach and demonstrate its implementation using a DI library."

## Serverless Architecture

**Prompt:** 
"Create a serverless architecture interview where the interviewer asks the candidate to design and implement a serverless function using Node.js. The candidate should deploy the function on a platform like AWS Lambda and demonstrate how to handle events and integrate with other AWS services."
