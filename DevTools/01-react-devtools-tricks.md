|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Inspect React Component**         | Inspect the props and state of a React component.                           | Select a component in the React DevTools and type `$r` in the console to inspect it.                                |
| **Log Component Updates**           | Track when and why a component re-renders.                                  | In React DevTools, enable "Highlight Updates" and watch console logs for updates.                                   |
| **Access Component Instance**       | Access the instance of a React component from the console.                  | `$r` gives you access to the selected component instance, where you can inspect methods, state, and props.         |
| **Trigger Component Re-render**     | Programmatically trigger a re-render of a component.                        | `$r.forceUpdate();` to force a re-render of the selected component.                                                 |
| **Manually Update Component State** | Manually change the state of a React component.                             | `$r.setState({ key: 'value' });` to update the state of the selected component.                                     |
| **Simulate Props Change**           | Simulate a change in props to test component behavior.                      | `$r.props = { newProp: 'value' }; $r.forceUpdate();` to simulate new props.                                         |
| **Inspect Component Methods**       | Access and test component methods from the console.                         | `$r.methodName();` to call a method of the selected component.                                                      |
| **Analyze Component Hierarchy**     | Visualize the component tree and parent-child relationships.                | In React DevTools, hover over components to see their hierarchy, or log `$r._reactInternals` for a detailed tree.   |
| **Check Fiber Node**                | Inspect the Fiber node of a React component.                                | `$r._reactInternals` gives you access to the Fiber node and internal structure.                                     |
| **Display React Component Name**    | Log the name of a React component.                                          | `console.log($r.constructor.name);` to log the name of the selected component.                                      |
| **Time Component Rendering**        | Measure the time taken for a component to render.                           | `console.time('render'); $r.forceUpdate(); console.timeEnd('render');` to time a re-render.                         |
| **Log Component Render Reason**     | Understand why a component re-rendered.                                     | Use the `why-did-you-render` library to automatically log re-render reasons.                                        |
| **Capture State Snapshot**          | Capture and log a snapshot of the component's state.                        | `const stateSnapshot = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify($r.state)); console.log(stateSnapshot);`                           |
| **Monitor Component Performance**   | Use React's built-in Profiler to analyze component performance.             | In React DevTools, use the "Profiler" tab to monitor and analyze component rendering performance.                   |
| **Highlight Components**            | Visually highlight components on the screen.                                | In React DevTools, enable "Highlight Updates" to see when and where components update.                              |
| **Simulate Error Boundary**         | Test how a component reacts to errors by manually throwing an error.        | `$r.setState(() => { throw new Error('Test Error'); });` to simulate an error and test error boundaries.            |
| **Unmount a Component**             | Programmatically unmount a component from the DOM.                          | `$r.componentWillUnmount();` to trigger the unmount lifecycle method and remove the component.                      |
| **Access Context Values**           | Access the current context value within a component.                        | `console.log($r.context);` to inspect the current context value of a selected component.                            |
| **Debug Hooks**                     | Inspect the state of React Hooks used in a component.                       | `console.log($r.hooks);` to view the current state of Hooks in the selected component (works with React DevTools).  |
