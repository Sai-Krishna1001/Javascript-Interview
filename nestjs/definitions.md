1. **Module**: **Container**  
   A module in NestJS acts as a container that groups related components, services, and controllers.

2. **Controller**: **Request-handler**

3. **Service**: **Logic**  
   Services hold the business logic and are injected into controllers or other services.

4. **Provider**: **Dependency**  
   Providers in NestJS are classes that can be injected as dependencies across the app.

5. **Middleware**: **Interceptor**  
   Middleware functions intercept and modify requests before they reach the controller.

6. **Decorator**: **Metadata**  
   Decorators are used to attach metadata to classes and methods, defining routes, validation, and more.

7. **Guard**: **Authorization**  
   Guards determine if a request should be allowed through based on authorization logic.

8. **Interceptor**: **Response-modifier**  
   Interceptors modify or transform responses before they are sent to the client.

9. **Pipe**: **Validator**  
   Pipes validate or transform incoming data before passing it to the controller.

10. **Filter**: **Exception-handler**  
    Exception filters catch and handle errors thrown in the application, customizing error responses.

11. **Gateway**: **WebSocket**  
    Gateways handle WebSocket connections, allowing real-time communication between the client and server.

12. **Dependency Injection**: **Auto-injector**  
    Dependency injection automatically provides instances of classes (like services) to other classes.

13. **Decorator**: **Annotation**  
    A decorator is a special type of syntax that adds extra functionality or annotations to classes or methods.

14. **NestFactory**: **Application-bootstrap**  
    `NestFactory` is used to create and configure the NestJS application at the start.

15. **Repository**: **Data-access**  
    A repository handles database operations and provides a way to access and manipulate data.

16. **DTO**: **Data-transfer**  
    Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) define the shape and structure of data sent in requests.

17. **Interceptor**: **Wrapper**  
    Interceptors wrap method execution to add extra behavior, like logging or transforming responses.

18. **EventEmitter**: **Asynchronous**  
    Event Emitters provide a mechanism for asynchronous communication between parts of the app.

19. **@Injectable**: **Service-declaration**  
    `@Injectable` is a decorator used to mark a class as a provider that can be injected elsewhere.

20. **Fastify**: **Alternative-server**
