### Q1: What is WebSocket and how does it differ from HTTP?
**A1**: WebSocket is a communication protocol that enables two-way, full-duplex communication between client and server. Unlike HTTP, which is stateless and requires the client to initiate requests, WebSocket allows the server to send data to the client at any time once the connection is established.
