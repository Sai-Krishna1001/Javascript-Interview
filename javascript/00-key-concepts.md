# Key JavaScript Concepts Every Developer Should Know

1. **Hoisting**  
   `var` is hoisted and initialized as `undefined`; `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, causing `ReferenceError` if accessed early.

2. **Closures in Loops**  
   Use `let` in loops to create block-scoped variables, preventing issues with asynchronous operations.

3. **Type Coercion**  
   JavaScript auto-converts types in operations, leading to unexpected results with `==` (use `===` for strict comparison).

4. **IIFE Scope**  
   Variables declared without `var`, `let`, or `const` in an IIFE are globally scoped.

5. **Reference vs Value**  
   Objects and arrays are passed by reference; changes affect all references to the same object.

6. **Truthy and Falsy**  
   Understand `truthy` and `falsy` values; e.g., `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN` are `falsy`.

7. **Destructuring Defaults**  
   Destructuring allows setting default values, used if no value is provided.

8. **Prototype Chain**  
   Objects created with `Object.create()` inherit properties from a prototype object.

9. **Function Overloading**  
   JavaScript doesn’t support function overloading; the last defined function with the same name overrides previous ones.

10. **Event Loop**  
    JavaScript’s single-threaded event loop handles asynchronous operations like callbacks and promises.

11. **Strict Mode**  
    `"use strict";` enforces stricter parsing, catching common errors and avoiding problematic features.

12. **Immutable Strings**  
    Strings in JavaScript are immutable; operations create new strings rather than modifying the original.

13. **Arrow Functions**  
    Arrow functions inherit `this` from their surrounding context, making them ideal for callbacks.

14. **Promises and Async/Await**  
    Promises and `async/await` simplify handling asynchronous code over traditional callbacks.

15. **Scope Chains and Closures**  
    Functions retain access to the scope in which they were created, even after that scope has exited.

16. **Temporal Dead Zone**  
    `let` and `const` are inaccessible before declaration, even though they’re hoisted.

17. **Event Delegation**  
    Attach one event listener to a parent element to handle events for multiple child elements efficiently.

18. **Debouncing and Throttling**  
    Control function execution frequency with debouncing (delay) or throttling (limit rate).

19. **Garbage Collection**  
    JavaScript automatically manages memory, but be cautious of memory leaks with long-lived objects.

20. **Module Systems**  
    Use ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) for modular, reusable code across files, replacing older patterns.
