## JavaScript Promise Methods:

- **Promise.all:** Ensure to handle the case where any single promise fails, as it will reject the entire result.
    ```mermaid
      graph LR
       A[Promise.all 👩‍👩‍👧‍👧] -->|✅ All promises resolved| B[Result: Array of results 🏆]
       A -->|❌ Any promise rejected| C[Result: First rejection 😠]
    ```
---
- **Promise.allSettled:** Useful for scenarios where you want to ensure all operations have completed, regardless of their success or failure.
  ```mermaid
      graph LR
       D[Promise.allSettled 🌍] -->|✅ All promises completed| E["Result: Array of [status 📋, value/reason 💡]"]
    ```
---
- **Promise.race:** Ideal for cases where you need the quickest response, but be cautious of failures if the first settled promise is a rejection.
  ```mermaid
      graph LR
       F[Promise.race 🚀] -->|✅ First promise resolved or rejected| G[Result: First result 🥇]
    ```
---
- **Promise.any:** Provides resilience by allowing you to proceed with the first successful promise, great for fault-tolerant systems.
    ```mermaid
      graph LR
       H[Promise.any 😎] -->|✅ First promise resolved| I[Result: First fulfillment 🎉]
       H -->|❌ All promises rejected| J[Result: Aggregate error 💥]
    ```
