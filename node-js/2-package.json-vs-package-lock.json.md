## Key Differences Between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

### `package.json`

- **Purpose:**
  - Manifest file containing metadata about the project and its dependencies.
  - Defines project settings, scripts, and dependencies.

- **Content:**
  - Lists dependencies required by the project (both direct and indirect).
  - Contains project metadata such as name, version, author, license.

- **Management:**
  - Manually edited by developers to add/update dependencies or scripts.
  - Used for defining project configuration and specifying dependencies.

### `package-lock.json`

- **Purpose:**
  - Automatically generated file (npm 5+) that records exact versions of installed packages.
  - Ensures consistent builds by locking down versions of all packages and their dependencies.

- **Content:**
  - Records exact version numbers of each installed package, including transitive dependencies.
  - Includes integrity hashes for security and reproducibility.

- **Management:**
  - Auto-generated and updated by npm or Yarn when dependencies are installed or updated.
  - Should not be manually edited; managed by package manager for reproducible builds.

### Key Differences:

- **Modification:**
  - Developers manually edit `package.json` for project-specific configurations.
  - `package-lock.json` is auto-generated and managed by npm or Yarn to ensure consistent dependencies.

- **Usage:**
  - `package.json` defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
  - `package-lock.json` ensures reproducibility of builds by locking down exact versions of dependencies.

These files work together to define project structure, dependencies, and ensure consistency across different environments and developers.
