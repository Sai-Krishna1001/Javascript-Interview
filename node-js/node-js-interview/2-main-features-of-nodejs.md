# Main Features of Node.js Interview Questions

## Main features of Node.js?

1. **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**
   - All APIs of Node.js library are asynchronous, meaning non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js-based server never waits for an API to return data.

2. **Very Fast**
   - Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.

3. **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**
   - Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping, allowing the server to respond in a non-blocking way and making it highly scalable, as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.

4. **No Buffering**
   - Node.js applications output data in chunks without buffering any data.

5. **Cross-Platform**
   - Node.js can be used to create cross-platform applications, such as web, mobile, and desktop applications, by leveraging frameworks like Electron and NW.js.

6. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**
   - Node.js comes with NPM, a package manager that includes a rich set of reusable components, making development faster and easier.

7. **Community and Ecosystem**
   - Node.js has a large and active community that contributes to its ecosystem, providing a wealth of open-source libraries and tools for developers to use.

8. **Real-Time Capabilities**
   - Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications like chat applications and online gaming, thanks to its event-driven architecture.

9. **Stream API**
   - Node.js has a robust Stream API that allows for the processing of streaming data. This is particularly useful for handling large files and for building data-intensive applications.

10. **JSON Support**
    - JSON is the native data format for Node.js, making it easy to build APIs and work with data stores like MongoDB that natively use JSON.

11. **Microservices Architecture**
    - Node.js supports microservices architecture, making it a good choice for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
   
## Q1: What is Single Threaded Programming?

**A1:** Single Threaded Programming refers to the execution model where a single thread is responsible for handling all tasks and operations within an application.

## Q2: What is Synchronous programming?

**A2:** Synchronous programming is a programming paradigm where operations are executed one after another in a sequential manner, blocking the execution of further code until the current operation is completed.

## Q3: What is Multi Threaded Programming?

**A3:** Multi Threaded Programming is a programming paradigm where multiple threads are used to perform multiple tasks concurrently within an application.

## Q4: What is Asynchronous Programming?

**A4:** Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm where tasks are executed independently from the main program flow, allowing the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

## Q5: What is the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming?

**A5:** The main difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming is that synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, blocking the execution of further code until the current task is completed, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to execute independently, enabling the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for asynchronous operations to complete.

## Q6: What are events, event emitter, event queue, event loop, and event driven?

**A6:** 
- **Events:** Signals that indicate that a certain condition or action has occurred within a program.
- **Event Emitter:** An object that emits events.
- **Event Queue:** A queue that holds events waiting to be processed.
- **Event Loop:** Continuously checks the event queue for new events and processes them sequentially.
- **Event-driven:** A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by events.

## Q7: What are the main features and advantages of Node.js?

**A7:** 
- Non-blocking I/O
- Asynchronous and event-driven
- Lightweight and efficient
- Cross-platform
- Large ecosystem of libraries (npm)

## Q8: What are the disadvantages of Node.js?

**A8:** 
- Not suitable for CPU-intensive tasks
- Callback hell (complex nested callbacks)
- Limited multi-threading capabilities
- Unstable API (due to frequent updates)
