## _Typescript Utility types_:

* `Partial` changes all the properties in an object to be optional.

* `Required` changes all the properties in an object to be required.

* `Record` is a shortcut to defining an object with a specific key type and value type.

* `Omit` removes keys from an object type.

* `Pick` removes all but the specified keys from an object type.

* `Exclude` removes types from a union.

* `ReturnType` extracts the return type of a function type.

* `Parameters` extracts the parameter types of a function type as an array.

* `Readonly` is used to create a new type where all properties are readonly, meaning they cannot be modified once assigned a value.
