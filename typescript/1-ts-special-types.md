## _Typescript special types_

* `any` is a type that disables type checking and effectively allows all types to be used.
* `unknown` is a similar, but safer alternative to any
* `never` effectively throws an error whenever it is defined
* `undefined` and `null` are types that refer to the JavaScript primitives `undefined`and `null` respectively.

* These types don't have much use unless strictNullChecks is enabled in the tsconfig.json file.
