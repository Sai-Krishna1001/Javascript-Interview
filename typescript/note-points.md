## _Important points need to remember_ ✔✔✔

* Javascript is a loosely typed language.
* Typescript is a syntactic superset of Javascript which adds static typing.
* Typescript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.
* Typescript being converted into Javascript means it runs anywhere that Javascript runs. 
* Having TypeScript "guess" the type of a value is called __infer__.
